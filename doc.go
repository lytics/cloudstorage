/*
Package cloudstorage is an interface to make Local, Google, s3 file storage
share a common interface to aid testing local as well as
running in the cloud.

The primary goal is to create a Store which is a common interface
over each of the (google, s3, local-file-system, azure) etc file storage
systems.   Then the methods (Query, filter, get, put) are common, as are
the Files (Objects) themselves.  Writing code that supports multiple
backends is now simple.

# Creating and iterating files

In this example we are going to create a local-filesystem
store.

	// This is an example of a local-storage (local filesystem) provider:
	config := &cloudstorage.Config{
		Type: localfs.StoreType,
		TokenSource:     localfs.AuthFileSystem,
		LocalFS:         "/tmp/mockcloud",
		TmpDir:          "/tmp/localcache",
	}
	store, _ := cloudstorage.NewStore(config)

	// Create a query to define the search path
	q := cloudstorage.NewQuery("list-test/")

	// Create an Iterator to list files
	iter := store.Objects(context.Background(), q)
	for {
		o, err := iter.Next()
		if err == iterator.Done {
			break
		}
		log.Println("found object %v", o.Name())
	}
